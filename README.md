This repo is just to demo a bug:

Use '''docker-compose up''' to run the demo

- on my local dev env(osx or win) erverthing works just fine, mongodb connects successful 
- on cloud hosted linux system (ubuntu 14.04, centOS, fedora) connection times out after some minutes

Does the docker host accutally matter ?
